    <p>Born in 1988, Jacob Shriner lives and works in Northern Indiana.
       A close student of Post-Impressionism and German Expressionism,
       he is a largely self-taught artist working in oil, charcoal and ink.</p>
       <h2>Artist’s Statement:</h2>
    <p>
       My work primarily focuses on existential issues of identity, human vulnerability,
       and man’s relationship with his own interior self, his physical body, and the exterior world.
       Deeply influenced by extensive study of history, philosophy, psychology, and literature,
       I seek to elucidate the internal life of my own mind in relation to external existence with the
       purpose of establishing subjective meaning and greater self-awareness through systems of symbolic
       visual narratives exploring themes of isolation as an intellectual condition, anxiety as a consequence of
       conflict between the mind and physicality, and the complex, often troubling nature of sexuality and human relations.
